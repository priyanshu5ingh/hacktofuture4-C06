## Problem Statement / Idea

Clearly describe the problem you are solving.

- What is the problem?

Traditional authentication mechanisms, such as passwords or Single Sign-On (SSO), only verify an identity at the initial point of login, which creates a significant security gap for autonomous AI agents that maintain persistent sessions

. If an agent's token is stolen or its intent is hijacked via prompt injection mid-session, attackers can move laterally through a network at machine speed with unrestricted access

. Furthermore, traditional security models are built on the flawed assumption that trust is static, whereas in the modern enterprise, Non-Human Identities (NHIs) now outnumber human identities by as much as 50:1, making them the top cybersecurity threat


- Why is it important?

. Proactive Defense: It shifts cybersecurity from a reactive model of patching vulnerabilities to a proactive, self-healing defense that can autonomously contain threats at machine speed

. Reducing Risk: By using ephemeral (short-lived) credentials, the system reduces the window of opportunity for stolen credentials by up to 75%

. Regulatory Compliance: It directly implements the requirements of the Cloud Security Alliance’s (CSA) new Agentic Trust Framework (ATF) for governing non-human actors

. Scalability: Because the system is decentralized, it allows millions of machine-to-machine interactions to scale without the bottlenecks of a central Identity Provider (IdP)

. Safety Assurance: The safety of future enterprise systems will not depend on how "smart" an AI is, but on how rigorously it can be monitored and contained when its behavior drifts from its intended purpose


- Who are the target users?

. Enterprises using Autonomous AI: Organizations that deploy AI agents to handle sensitive data or interact with internal APIs and databases

. Cloud & Infrastructure Teams: Users operating in Kubernetes and Docker environments who need to securely scope and manage machine identities

. Cybersecurity & Compliance Officers: Professionals who must ensure their AI deployments align with emerging standards like the CSA’s Agentic Trust Framework

. Developers of Agentic AI: Those building the next generation of autonomous intelligence who require a decentralized infrastructure to safely scale their applications

## Proposed Solution

Explain your approach:

- What are you building?

I am building Aegis-DID (Agentic Ephemeral Governance & Identity System), a decentralized Zero Trust architecture specifically designed for the era of autonomous AI agents

. This system is a closed-loop security framework that integrates cryptographic identity (using SPIFFE/SPIRE), kernel-level observability (via eBPF), and AI-driven analytics (using Neo4j and PyTorch) to manage and secure non-human identities

. It is designed to run in modern orchestration environments like Kubernetes and Docker, ensuring that every AI workload has a verified, verifiable, and temporary identity

- How does it solve the problem?

Traditional security models fail because they only verify an identity at the initial login, which is insufficient for AI agents that maintain long, persistent sessions
. Aegis-DID solves this by shifting to a continuous identity verification model

. Eliminating Static Risk: Instead of using permanent API keys, the system issues highly ephemeral cryptographic identity documents (SVIDs) that expire in minutes or seconds, reducing the time a stolen credential can be used by 75%

. Monitoring Behavioral Intent: While the agent is active, the system uses eBPF and OpenTelemetry to capture real-time telemetry

. A causal inference engine then analyzes this data to detect "intent drift"—signs that an agent’s behavior has been hijacked, perhaps through a prompt injection attack

. Autonomous Containment: If the system detects suspicious behavior, the agent’s Trust Score drops

. This immediately triggers the Open Policy Agent (OPA) to autonomously strip the agent of its permissions or use Kubernetes NetworkPolicies to physically isolate the compromised pod, "self-healing" the perimeter at machine speed

- What makes your solution unique?
Our approach is unique because it moves beyond simple authentication to dynamic, behavior-gated governance

. Zero-Instrumentation Monitoring: By using eBPF, we can monitor an agent's activities at the kernel level without needing to modify the agent's code or adding any performance latency

. Decentralized Scalability: Unlike traditional systems that rely on a central Identity Provider (IdP) which can become a bottleneck, our decentralized architecture allows millions of machine-to-machine interactions to scale efficiently

. Causal Behavioral Mapping: We utilize Neo4j to construct StateGraphs of agent behavior, allowing us to compare real-time actions against historical baselines using advanced causal inference, which is more sophisticated than simple rule-based security

. Regulatory Alignment: Aegis-DID is one of the first systems to directly implement the requirements of the Cloud Security Alliance’s (CSA) Agentic Trust Framework (ATF), providing a ready-made path for enterprises to meet new safety standards for non-human actors
